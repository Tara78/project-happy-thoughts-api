# Project Happy Thoughts API
- This is a backend project which connected to our perivous project happy thought. 
- User can POST a text which the text will send to our API and then the new data save as a new objects in Mongo database.

## The problem

Increasing heart number was a bit challenging for me. I could increas from the post man not in frontend. 
The problem was, I used PATCH method in backend and I had POST method in frontend, which was a case of Error.
